To do app created using react js Node js and MongoDb
Steps to run application locally

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js and npm**: You can download and install them from [the official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Git**: You can download and install it from [the official Git website](https://git-scm.com/).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project. Then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Backend

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install the backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The backend server should now be running, typically accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Step 3: Set Up the Frontend

1. Open a new terminal window or tab.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your-repository
   ```

3. Install the frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend server should now be running, typically accessible at `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:3001`.

## Environment Variables

If your project requires environment variables, create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory based on the provided `.env.example` file. Fill in the necessary values.

Example:

```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.mongodb.net/notes
PORT=3000
```

## Database Setup

If your project uses a database, provide instructions here to set it up. This might include creating a database, running migrations, or seeding data.

Example for MongoDB:

1. Ensure MongoDB is running locally or configure your `MONGO_URI` to connect to a remote MongoDB instance.
2. No further setup required if using a hosted MongoDB service like MongoDB Atlas.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Port Already in Use

If you encounter an error that the port is already in use, you can change the port in your `.env` file or free up the port.

### Issue 2: Missing Dependencies

If you encounter errors about missing dependencies, make sure you have run `npm install` in both the `backend` and root directories.
